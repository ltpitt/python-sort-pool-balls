# A Python class to sort Pool balls

Team Code challenge to create and sort a set of pool balls.  
We don't strive for the 'best' solution, it's not a competition.  
We do of course strive to have good Pythonic solutions so any feedback is welcome, but do respect the newby / learner.  

Again, learning more + better Python is the main objective.  
We believe solving code challenges is a very effective way to achieve this.  

## How to install
* **Python** (<3) is required. If you have Linux or Mac you should be good to go and you should skip to the next step, if you're on Windows and you like lazy'n'great you can install Python with a couple clicks from: http://ninite.com
* Clone the repository or simply download it as a zip file and unzip it in your local folder

You are now good to go.
